# Flux

Flux is a decentralized, event-native system where orchestration emerges from observation and response rather than control.

There is no central brain in Flux. There is no workflow, no ordered execution, and no authority that decides what happens next. Instead, Flux is shaped by immutable events, autonomous Sensors, and convergence toward stable states.

Flux is not a tool for enforcing order.  
Flux is a system for reacting to reality.

## What Flux Is

Flux is a distributed environment in which:

- Changes are expressed as immutable events
- Events are recorded as verifiable facts
- Independent Sensors observe those events
- Sensors act when their conditions are met
- Actions emit new events
- The system converges over time

Coordination is not designed.  
It emerges.

---

## What Flux Is Not

Flux is explicitly **not**:

- A workflow engine
- A pipeline
- A DAG executor
- A state machine controller
- A centralized orchestrator
- A system that promises exactly-once execution

If you are looking for control, ordering, or guarantees of sequence, Flux is the wrong system.

## The Core Idea

In Flux:

- **Events are the only cause**
- **Sensors are the only actors**
- **State is inferred, not commanded**
- **Truth is verified, not trusted**
- **Stability is temporary**

Flux assumes that:
- Events may be duplicated
- Sensors may fail
- Systems may partially converge
- The environment will change again

Flux is built to survive this reality, not deny it.

## Sensors

Sensors are autonomous agents.

A Sensor:
- Subscribes to events
- Evaluates conditions using current state
- Acts only when its criteria are satisfied
- Records what it did
- Emits new events

Sensors do not coordinate with each other.
They do not wait for permission.
They do not assume order.

They simply respond.

---

## Orchestration by Emergence

Flux does not orchestrate by instruction.

Orchestration emerges because:
- Multiple Sensors observe the same facts
- Each Sensor applies its own logic
- The combined effect moves the system toward stability

No component knows the full plan.
No component needs to.

---

## Platforms and Clouds

Flux is platform-agnostic.

Cloud platforms do not host Flux.
They inject signals into it.

AWS, Azure, and others are:
- Event sources
- Execution substrates
- Nothing more

Flux does not belong to any platform.

---

## Truth and Verification

Flux does not decide what is true.

Events are attested and verified using xDAO / CATF.
History is immutable.
State can be replayed.
Claims can be audited.

Flux reacts to truth.
It does not manufacture it.

---

## Why Flux

The name *Flux* is intentionally abstract.

It does not describe a product.
It does not imply a workflow.
It does not prescribe behavior.

Meaning in Flux comes from:
- What actually happened
- What reacted
- What converged

Not from what was planned.

---

## In One Sentence

Flux is a system where **reality emits signals, autonomous agents respond, and order emerges without control**.
