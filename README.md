# Flux

Flux is a decentralized, event-native system where orchestration emerges from observation, response, and convergence rather than control.

Flux rejects centralized workflow engines, ordered execution, and global coordination. Instead, autonomous Sensors react to immutable events, evaluate conditions against shared state, and emit new events that drive the system toward stable states.

Cloud platforms do not host Flux. They inject signals into it.

## Core Principles
- No central orchestrator
- Events as the sole driver of behavior
- Sensors as the only actors that change the world
- Emergent orchestration, not prescribed workflows
- Idempotency over ordering
- Convergence over completion
- Verifiable truth via CATF

Flux is platform-agnostic and designed to integrate with systems such as AWS, Azure, or any environment capable of emitting immutable events.
